    <h3>Import bans</h3>
    <p>
      An import ban imposed in 1898 by the United States on Indian mangoes,
      including the Alphonso, was lifted only in April 2007.However,the mangoes
      needed to be trated before entering the country in order to stop the
      introduction of non-native fruit flies, destructive fungi,and other pests
      that could harm America agriculture.The European Union imposed a ban
      beginning in April 2014 on import of mangoes after finding "non-European
      fruit flies" in some consignments, creating a significant threat to UK
      salad crops. The Indian government had described this descision as
      arbitrary and business claimed they would suffer financial losses due to
      the ban.
      <br />
      In January 2015, the European Commission lifted the ban following
      significant improvements in the Indian mango export system.

      The Kesar mango, is a mango cultivar groun in the foothills of Girnar in
      Gujrat, western India. The mango is known for its bright orange colored
      pulp and was given the geographical indication status in 2011.
    </p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      The mango was grown in 1931 by Junagadh Wazir Sale Bhai in Vanthali. About
      75 grafts were then planted in the foothills of Girnar at the Junagadh
      Laal Dori farm. The mango is said to have known as "Kesar" since 1934 when
      the Nawab of Junagadh Muhammad Mahabat Khan III said "This is Kesar"
      looking at the orange pulp of the fruit--kesar being Hindi for saffron.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Production</h3>
    <p>
      The Kesar mango is grown in an approximate area of 20,000 hectare in the
      districts of Junagadh and Amreli in the Saurashtra region of Gujrat, with
      an estimated annual production of two lakh tonnes. However, only the mango
      grown around the Gir sanctuary area is officially known as "Gir Kesar
      mango".
      <br />
      This variety of mango is usally produced do the market in April, with the
      cultivation beginning around October after the monsoon season. Kesar
      variety is among the most expensive varieties of the fruit.

    <h3>Geographical Indication</h3>
    <p>
      Gujrat Agro Industries Corporation (GAIC) Ltd proposed the geographical
      indication(GI) registration of Gir Kesar mango. After the Junagadh
      Agricultural University filed the application in 2010, the fruit was
      granted the GI tag in 2011 by the Geographical Indication Registry in
      Chennai, majing the name "Gir Kesar" exclusive to the mangoes grown in the
      region. In thus became the first agricultural product from Gujrat and the
      second mango variety in India (after Uttar Pradesh's Dasheri mango) to
      earn the GI tag.
